Fresh from a voyage on great Lake Burley Griffin the Canberra Shanty Club will teach you how to confidently strut the quarterdeck and belt out a shanty refrain.

Sea shanties, working songs and rousing chorus antics will fill your soul with energy and leave you wanting more.

Canberra Shanty Club is a community singing group that sings sea shanties, working songs and all manner of folk chorus tunes.

All singing levels are welcome. Due to the all-sing nature of the songs these sessions are very friendly to those who get nervous singing in front of others. Join us and we'll prove that you too can sing without fear.
